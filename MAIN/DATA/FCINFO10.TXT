        Welcome to the FCINFO.TXT file version 1.0 !

        This textfile was written to tell you about Future Crew, to
        give you answers to most of the things you would probably like
        to ask us, and to tell you how to get more demos.

        If you are interested in us making a demo for you, please,
        start reading from the next paragraph in this file.

        The things discussed in this textfile are mainly aimed to
        those people who have not seen much demos before, but are very
        interested in learning more about them and about the whole
        demo scene (=demo world) in general. In the future versions
        there will be changes and additions taking into account what
        has happened since the last information package.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

        If you find our demos interesting and would like us to make
        you one for commercial purposes, do not hesitate to contact us.

        When contacting us, please, include a short explanation of
        what kind of a demo you are interested in. That would greatly
        help us in evaluating the size of the project.
        Kindly include, for example, these kinds of information:

        - What kinds of demo effects would you be interested in
        - Should there be any colorful still-pictures (logos, etc.)
        - If the demo should have sound, which sound cards would you like
          to be supported, what type of music should be played, etc.
        - How big the demo could be in kilobytes and for how long
          should the demo run in minutes approximately.
        - Where would the demo be used and how soon would you like the
          demo to be finished.

        We would like you to understand that our demos are not animations.
        This means that nearly everything you see on the screen is being
        real-time calculated. The speed of the movement is usually
        dependant to the speed of the VGA card and the speed of the
        processor.

        When contacting us, you should realise that we are all rather
        young and thus still studying in various schools. This is why
        our time is usually quite limited. And it is very likely that
        we might already be involved in another project.

        You should also know that we do not make demos for Microsoft
        Windows due to its limitations from an assembly language
        programming point of view.

        Since normal mail is quite a slow way to communicate, we would
        prefer the communication be made through e-mail or fax.

        You can find our contact information from this file.

        All our demos, except the ones which we have created for different

        This means that you can copy and distribute them freely as long
        as you make no modifications to them. Also, no money can be

        If you are a PD distributor, please contact us before including
        our products in your collection.

        In general, all commercial utilization of our demos without our
        permission is forbidden. This includes selling disks containing

│5:                     INTERNATIONAL DEMO COMPETITIONS                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

        For those who have no idea what the above are, I will explain.
        Demo competitions (= parties) are international events where
        the demo scene people go to meet each other and to compete in
        the many competitions that are being held. These competitions
        (= compos) are the demo, intro (= a demo sized under 100kb), 
        music and graphics. There are often different compos for different 
        machines (PC, Amiga, Atari ST and C-64). There are also prizes in
        each compo (cash or computer hardware & software). The cash prizes
        are usually the money people pay as the entrance fee (usually 
        about $20 US) and the possible computer hardware & software has
        usually been sponsored by various computer companies. All 
        contributions are being experienced on a big screen (many meters
        wide) and with the aid of a powerful audio system. After this all
        the people or a selected jury vote and decide which contributions
        are the best. After this the prizes are being given out and the 
        party is over. In the process people of course get to know each
        other better and exchange a lot of new ideas.

        All contributions are usually being released at the party itself,
        but sometimes the PC demos are not. This is very unfortunate,
        and will probably change in the future. The reason why this is
        allowed to happen is becouse most demos haven't been beta-tested
        well enough before the party and might not work on most machines.
        So, the groups are being allowed to finish their demos after the
        party and then release them when they so see fit.

        Parties usually last for three days (a weekend) and are usually
        organized by bigger demo groups.

        There are a few big demo parties being held annually.
        These include the following: The Party in Denmark at Christmas-
        time, The Gathering in Norway around Easter, The Computer
        Crossroad in Sweden before the summer and Assembly in Finland
        in the end of Summer. The biggest of these is The Party, which
        is being held for the third time this Christmas. And the most
        recent party was Assembly'93, which was held for the second time.

        A few months before the party, the organizing demo groups usually
        release special invitation demos to advertise their parties.

        At Assembly'93 there were a total of 1500 attenders from which
        550 were PC people. About half of them had come from outside
        Finland (Germany, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Norway, USA, Israel,
        Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, etc...). Only PC people were
        allowed to vote on PC compos.

        The overall quality of the contributions exceeded all expectations.
        It was very cool to see how much the PC scene had developed since
        last year. The party itself went quite smoothly, except for a
        few bumps, but what would a demo party be without them... :-)
        Also the prizes were very good in all PC compos. The total value
        of all the prizes on the PC was about $7800 US.

        Next we would like to thank all the companies which sponsored
        most of the PC side prizes at Assembly'93:

                Advanced Gravis, Canada

                Epic MegaGames, USA

                The Waite Group Press, USA

                Terton, Finland

                HiCompu, Finland

                Toptronics, Finland

                Pro Component, Finland

                Lan Vision, Finland

                Data Fellows, Finland


        The thanks to all the sponsoring companies are also in the end
        scroller of the demo. We hope to see you also next year!

        And to all you people out there:

        Don't forget to attend Assembly'94 next summer !

        We receive a lot of mail and simply can't answer all of it.
        Comments and opinions are always appreciated, but if you
        also have questions, consider first if you might find the
        answers elsewhere, for example from the Frequently Asked
        Questions section inside this file. However, if you include
        questions in your mail, please enclose a return envelope ready
        with your address and an international mail coupon.
        This would help us a lot.

        The best and the fastest way to contact us is through e-mail.
        So, if you really want to chat with us alot, you should find
        a way to use e-mail. From internet you can also find lots of
        demos and be able to e-mail other demo groups as well.

        A very good anonymous ftp site where you can find lots of
        demos is ftp.uwp.edu. Our demos can be found in the directory:
        pub/msdos/demos/groups/future.crew.

        You can also call our many BBSes around the world. You can
        find the list of these BBSes starting from page 23.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

        Here we have compiled a list of questions along with the
        answers (in random order) which are being asked in about
        95% of all the letters we receive. Hopefully you will find
        the answers to your questions from here and save us and
        yourself from some unneeded paperwork.

Q: Where can I get your and other groups' demos?
A: There are several ways to get demos.
   The best way (if you have a modem) is to call an FC distribution site
   near you. They have all of our productions online and you can download
   them freely. Also many normal BBSes carry our productions and other
   groups' demos. If you don't have a modem, then getting our demos is a
   lot harder. We don't have a mailswapping system. So, if you have a friend
   who has a modem, why not try to get him to call one of our distribution
   sites. Another VERY good way to get demos is from the INTERNET. A very
   good demo site is ftp.uwp.edu which carries probably the best demo
   collection on internet.

Q: When is Scream Tracker 3.0 going to be out?
A: Scream Tracker 3.0 is a product which might or might not ever be out.
   This is very ambiguous, but the problem is that ST3 is not a high
   priority project. The coder, Psi, is studying at a university, coding
   demos, doing commercial software and trying to spend some freetime.
   So at the moment there is no time to finish ST3 and no set release date.

Q: When is Worldcharts issue #2 coming out?
A: Not in a while. People haven't sent us enough votes and articles for a
   full new issue. Maybe it would be the time to do something about this?

Q: When is the musicdisk coming out ?
A: As soon as we have some time to finish it. There are lots of songs ready,
   but the musicdisk interface and graphics for it haven't been created yet.
   Maybe sometime next year.

Q: What programming books would you recommend to learn assembler and VGA?
A: This is a hard question, and a general answer is, that any book will do.
   You can get the basics from a book and books are a great reference,
   but when it comes to creating something new, you can't just read it
   from a book. We have all learned to code the hard way (a lot of
   miscellaneous books and a lot of experimenting). Anyway, here are 
   some of the books we often find handy (there are undoutedly newer 
   prints, so check them out):

        Mastering Turbo Assembler, Tom Swan
                Hayden Books 1989, ISBN 0-672-48435-8
        PC System Programming, Michael Tischer
                Abacus 1990, ISBN 1-55755-036-0
        The Programmers PC Sourcebook, Thom Hogan
                Microsoft Press 1988, ISBN 1-55615-118-7
        Programming the 80386, John H. Crawford and Patrick P. Gelsinger
                Sybex 1987, ISBN 0-89588-381-3
        Programmers guide to EGA and VGA cards, Richard F. Ferraro
                Addison Wesley 1989, ISBN 0-201-12692-3

   Also, most up to date are many software 'books', such as interrupt 
   lists from bbs'es and such. We have also found a lot of valuable
   information in articles and such. In short, there is no magic
   way of learning to code, it really does take hard work.

Q: Are you going to make games in the future ?
A: Why not. It all depends if we have the time. We have a few game
   ideas cooking, but they are far from being completed. But we will
   let you all know when we have a game coming, don't you worry!

Q: What do the members of Future Crew do besides computers ?
A: Most of us study in various schools; universities, high schools and
   colleges. In reallife most of us are quite normal(?) human beings.
   Our hobbies are for example, sci-fi, movies, weight-lifting, techno,
   hi-fi, etc, etc. And most of have or has had a girlfriend.

Q: What sound cards will you support?
A: At the moment our productions support the following sound cards:

        Gravis UltraSound   - for it's programming advantages
        Sound Blaster Pro   - for being a standard
        Sound Blaster       - same here

   Support to other sound cards is always possible, but right now we
   don't see enough demand to support any other cards.

Q: Why do your demos require a 386 or higher to run?
A: There are several reasons for the requirement; For example, 386 has many
   new assembler commands, 32bit registers, and of course more processing
   power. There isn't simply enough processing power in 286 to run a full
   ledged demo. And besides, 286-based machines are a dying breed.
   
Q: How did you learn to code as well as you do now?
A: Learning to code demos is a long and very very difficult process. It takes
   years to learn to code demos very well. A good way to start is some high
   level language like Pascal or C and then started to experiment with 
   assembler. It takes a lot of time and experimenting to get better, and
   there are no shortcuts (for book recommendations, see a question before
   this). The main thing is trying to understand what you do, then trying
   to change the program to see what you get, and gain wisdom in what's
   the best way of doing things. Learning to code well requires a lot of
   patience, a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of time. It is not easy.

Q: What programs do you use to do your demos?
A: We use the following programs to do our demos; For code we use 
   Borland C++, Microsoft C, Borland Pascal and of course TASM (Turbo
   Assembler). For graphics we use Deluxe Paint 2 Enchanded (and 3D Studio
   2.0). For making the music we use Scream Tracker 3.0 beta, and for 
   digitizing the samples for our songs we use Advanced DigiPlayer 2.5
   beta. Scream Tracker 3.0 and Advanced DigiPlayer are our own programs
   made by Psi, and they are not available to the public at this time.
   In addition to all these, we of course have a big collection of 
   utilities we have crafted to our need during the years.
   
Q: I'm a beginner programmer. I wonder if you could help me learn demo coding?
A: To help beginners learn the secrets of democoding we have released the
   full source of our Mental Surgery demo. This source code is spread along
   with our STMIK (Scream Tracker Music Interface Kit), which is a 4 channel
   music player, which you can link into your own programs. You can find these
   from our distribution sites, under the name STMIK020.ZIP (be sure to grab
   STMIKFIX.ZIP too, which fixes one nasty bug). Do not try to ask us send
   you some of our unreleased source code. When we feel that the time is
   right, we might compile a packet of some of our older routines for all
   of you to tear apart and possibly learn from. But as usual, there is no
   set release date for such a packet.

Q: What is the complete list of your released productions with release dates?
A: To date, we have released the following productions:

│10:                  CREATIVITY DEMO NET (CDN) INFORMATION                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Creativity Demo Net or shortly CDN is nowadays quite a common sight
among BBS'es that are oriented towards demos. But what exactly is CDN?

  The idea behind The Creativity Demo Net(work) is now about 2 years
old. I had been dreaming about having a way to communicate electronically
between different demogroups. When we (Future Crew) attended Megaleif
Easter Party'92 last year in Uppsala, Sweden, I was positively surprised
when I found out that Mirage / Cascada had also been thinking about the
same thing. We both thought that it was a good idea and began developing it.

  But it didn't work out as we intended. There were a lot of difficulties,
in Sweden and here in Finland. At first we tried to spread the net via FidoNet,
but soon it came clear to us that demogroups needed their own net. The
same time I had been also talking with Trojaner (SysOp of Skull's Southern
Germany HQ) and he was also inspired by this idea. We decided that Skull
and Future Crew wouldn't be enough to start a new net with, so I contacted
Arjan Pool (who had relations with DCE) and he also thought that the idea
was just great. And we got underway.

  At first the net was called just plainly DemoNet, but it was almost 
immediately changed to Creativity Demo Net. Anyway, at first it was planned
that StarPort would become the World HQ, but as Arjan wanted to take the job
and all the big responsibilities, Arco BBS became the WHQ (and still is). Much
of the coming success of CDN was based on Arjan's continuing hard work for CDN.

  The net started working in August 1992, four months after the first idea
about a demonet had come to me. And after that the net has spread like a
wildfire! At first CDN spanned only 3 countries (Finland, Holland and Germany)
but soon Sweden joined in, and then country after country and bbs after bbs
joined in. To this date CDN spans the following countries: Finland, Holland,
Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, England, Italy, Turkey, Belgium,
Canada, USA, France, Hungary, Brazil, Austria and Australia. THAT'S 18 
COUNTRIES! And there are about 140 nodes in CDN, all BBS's that are demogroup's
BBS'es. Considering the small amount of demogroup BBS'es, I would estimate
that about 75% of all demogroup BBSes are connected to CDN and all of the
biggest groups like FC, Triton, Renaissance, Cascada, etc... are connected
to the net.

  So what kind of echoes does CDN carry? Well here is the complete list of
echomail areas:
  
*    1. CDN.4ALL
        The area for everyone in CDN
*    2. CDN.ANNOUNCE
        Made a new demo ? announce it overhere.
*    3. CDN.DISKMAG
        All information about diskmagazines
%    4. CDN.CHAT
        All chatting with other members
%    5. CDN.PROGRAMMING
        For help with programming problems
%    6. CDN.GFX
        For all graphics makers
%    7. CDN.MUSIC
        MIDI/MOD/MUSIC help and questions
S    8. CDN.TEST
        Test area
!    9. CDN.INTERGROUP
        For selected groups within CDN
S   10. CDN.SYSOP
        Sysops CDN only
H   11. CDN.HQ_HOST
        For mail between HOSTS versus HQ

* - for everyone who gets
    connected to a BBS
% - for registered persons
    (demogroup members)
S - only for CDN sysops
H - only hosts and HQ
! - for special selected groups

  CDN has areas for relaxed talk between people (and it gets QUITE
relaxed sometimes, and QUITE weird =), but it's just fun!), and for
serious purposes such as programming.

  And what does CDN require from a BBS? Well, the first and MOST
important requirement is that the BBS is some demogroups (preferably an
active one) BBS. That is rule that there are only few exceptions from.
But otherwise, you just have to:

 - place the completed files of the CDN on his/her BBS that everyone
   can download them
 - use the CDN nodelist and it's updates
 - connect to every area available to them

  Not too many rules... And that is because we want CDN to be fun,
not some playground for idiots with a lawbook for brains.  
Also, there are ABSOLUTELY no charges in CDN, so the only costs you have to 
pay are your own phonebills.

  You can FREQ more info about from for example the WHQ under the magic name
CDNINFO. So, get more info now if you are interested in joining in!

│12:              HOW TO BECOME A FUTURE CREW DISTRIBUTION SITE               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

         We are looking for distribution sites around the world.
         We are looking for demo-oriented BBS'es that are interested
         in becoming part of FC's growing number of BBS'es.

         So, what does it take to become an FC distsite?
         In fact, it's not easy, we require a lot, but before
         giving up, take a look at the following list:
         
                 - Your BBS MUST have every single one production
                  FC or any member of FC has ever RELEASED
                
                - Your BBS has to call StarPort (FC WHQ) at least
                  twice a month, and keep in contact with the FC
                  
                - Your BBS also has to be a voting place for our possibly
                  continuing Worldcharts diskmag (voting door)
                  
                - Your BBS has to be absolutely DEMO-ORIENTED, NOT
                  some gigantic all-around BBS. YOU yourself have
                  to be very interested about demos and the PC demo
                  scene in general
                  
                - Your BBS should join the Creativity Demo Net, if
                  by any means possible
                  
                - Your BBS would also be a Future Crew information
                  forum. You would have to answer questions concerning
                  FC and our production, and help people who have
                  problems with our software
                  
                - Your BBS should be operated on a PC compatible,
                  with at least a 14400 BPS modem and 300 megabytes
                  of diskspace for demos, and the BBS should be open
                  24 hours a day, and 365 days / year

        So what do you get in exchange? Well, these things we can
        guarantee:
        
                - Your BBS will be mentioned in every FC production
                  in the distsite BBS list
                - You have a chance to get all FC's future productions
                  first hand
                - You will get some FC inner circle information
                
        What we can't guarantee, but what is likely to happen, is that
        your BBS will become more and more popular and it's quality
        will improve dramatically. 
        
        Remember that we already have BBSes in most of the european
        countries (check out the BBS list), but there are still some
        gaps left which we'd like to fill out. In the USA and Canada,
        we are accepting one BBS per state.

        Please read the above rules carefully and think twice before

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

        Copy the form to a file called VOTING.FRM, fill it out and send it
back to us and you will find your name in the Voter's List in the next issue
of our diskmag (= electronic magazine). And remember, you will have to fill at
least 7 entries on the demo and group charts and 5 entries on the coders,
musicians and graphicians, otherwise your vote will not be used and you will
not get in the Voter's List. By doing this we are trying to avoid getting only
a huge pile of crap votes. So, please, take your time and try to fill out the
entries as well as you can. If you haven't seen much demos, and don't really
know what to answer, and only want to see your name on the list, do not bother
filling this.

        And since this is the PC demo scene we are at, do not vote for any
Amiga, Atari ST, C-64 or other people or stuff, only PC.

        And you can't vote your own group, naturally.
